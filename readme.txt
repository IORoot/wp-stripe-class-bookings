Stripe Checkout booking for classes: capacity-aware dates, soft holds, webhooks, emails, reports, Elementor widget, and shortcode.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B6TxXcDt2E

**Class Bookings with Stripe** helps studios, instructors, and venues sell places on scheduled classes using **Stripe Checkout** (Stripe’s hosted payment page). Customers pick a date, choose seats, and pay securely without WooCommerce or a custom cart.

The plugin uses **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Free** (built in). Each bookable class has schedule, price, capacity, and optional extras. Embed the form with a shortcode or Elementor widget. When a customer clicks **Book & pay with Stripe**, the plugin creates a soft-hold, opens a Stripe Checkout Session, and redirects to Stripe. A signed webhook marks the booking paid and can send customer and admin emails.

= Features =

* **Classes** — Weekly recurring classes, one-off events, or external booking links.
* **Capacity** — Per class and date; counts paid bookings and active soft-holds.
* **Cancelled dates** — Block individual dates without disabling the class.
* **Bookings** — Pending, paid, and expired statuses with Stripe session references.
* **Reports** — Yearly charts, upcoming attendance, and guest lists.
* **Form extras** — Waiver, Mailchimp opt-in, and custom ACF fields.
* **Emails** — Customer and admin templates with merge tags via `wp_mail()`.
* **Result pages** — Booking Confirmed, Cancelled, and Error pages on activation.

= Stripe Checkout =

The plugin uses the bundled **stripe-php** SDK. It does not embed card fields on your site. Checkout Sessions use inline `price_data` (GBP), session metadata, and a 30-minute soft-hold aligned with session expiry. Configure webhooks for `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, and `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`.

= Shortcodes =

* `[clasbowi_booking class_id="123"]`
* `[clasbowi_booking_status type="success"]` (or `cancelled`, `error`)

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.0+
* Stripe account (keys and webhook signing secret)
* ACF Free or Pro (bundled ACF Free loads if ACF is not active)
* Elementor (optional, for the Elementor widget)

== External services ==

This plugin connects to third-party services to process payments and, optionally, add customers to a mailing list. You must configure your own accounts and API keys for these services in **Class Bookings with Stripe → Settings**.

= Stripe =

This plugin uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) Checkout to collect payments. Stripe hosts the payment page; card details are entered on Stripe’s site, not in WordPress.

**When data is sent**

* When a customer submits the booking form, your WordPress site calls the Stripe API to create a Checkout Session, then redirects the browser to Stripe’s hosted checkout page.
* When payment completes, fails, or the session expires, Stripe sends signed webhook events to your site (`/wp-json/clasbowi/v1/stripe-webhook`).
* If webhooks are delayed, the plugin may call the Stripe API again to retrieve the Checkout Session status when the customer returns to your success page.

**What data is sent**

* To Stripe’s API (server-side): your Stripe secret key (authentication), customer name and email, class and booking details (class name, date, time, location, seats, booking ID), line-item title and price (GBP), and success/cancel return URLs.
* On Stripe Checkout (customer-facing): payment and billing details the customer enters on Stripe’s hosted page.
* From Stripe to your site (webhooks): event payloads about the Checkout Session and payment status (no card numbers are stored in WordPress).

This service is provided by Stripe, Inc.: [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa), [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

= Mailchimp =

If enabled in plugin settings, this plugin can subscribe customers to a Mailchimp audience when they opt in on the booking form.

**When data is sent**

* After a booking is marked paid (via Stripe webhook), and only when all of the following are true: Mailchimp opt-in is enabled in settings, you have saved a Mailchimp API key and Audience ID, the customer checked the opt-in box on the form, and the booking has not already been synced.

**What data is sent**

* To the Mailchimp Marketing API: the customer’s email address, first name, last name (parsed from the booking name), and subscription status (`pending` if double opt-in is enabled, otherwise `subscribed`). Your Mailchimp API key is sent in the request for authentication.

This service is provided by Intuit Mailchimp: [Terms of Use](https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/), [Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).
