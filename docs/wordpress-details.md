## Short Description (max ~150 characters)

Stripe Checkout booking for classes: capacity-aware dates, soft holds, webhooks, emails, reports, Elementor widget, and shortcode.

---

## Description

**Class Bookings with Stripe** is a WordPress plugin for studios, instructors, and venues that sell places on scheduled classes. It connects your site to **Stripe Checkout** (Stripe’s hosted payment page) so customers pick a date, choose how many seats they need, and pay securely without you building a custom cart or WooCommerce store.

The plugin is built around **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**. Each class is a **Class** in the admin: you set location, schedule, price, capacity, and optional extras. The booking form is embedded with a shortcode or Elementor widget. When someone clicks **Book & pay with Stripe**, the plugin creates a temporary reservation, opens a Stripe Checkout Session, and sends the customer to Stripe to complete payment. A signed webhook confirms payment, updates the booking, and can send customer and admin emails.

### What you can manage

* **Classes** — Weekly recurring classes, one-off events, or classes that link out to an external booking URL (ClassFor, Eventbrite, etc.) instead of the built-in form.
* **Capacity** — Per class and per date; remaining seats account for paid bookings and active soft-holds.
* **Cancelled dates** — Block individual dates via a repeater on the class; the form skips them automatically.
* **Pause bookings** — Toggle **Class is active (bookable)** off to stop new bookings without deleting the class.
* **Bookings list** — Every attempt is stored (pending, paid, expired) with customer details and Stripe session references.
* **Reports** — Yearly booking charts, upcoming attendance, and guest lists by class.
* **Form extras** — Optional waiver checkbox, Mailchimp opt-in, and custom ACF fields on the booking form.
* **Emails** — Customisable customer and admin templates with merge tags, sent via WordPress `wp_mail()`.
* **Result pages** — On activation, the plugin creates **Booking Confirmed**, **Booking Cancelled**, and **Booking Error** pages using `[stripe_booking_status]`.

### How Stripe Checkout integration works

Stripe Checkout is Stripe’s hosted, PCI-compliant payment flow. This plugin does **not** embed card fields on your WordPress page. Instead it uses the official **stripe-php** SDK (bundled in the plugin) to create a **Checkout Session** in `payment` mode and redirect the browser to Stripe.

**1. Customer submits the form**

The front-end form (shortcode `[stripe_booking class_id="123"]` or the **Class Booking with Stripe** Elementor widget) collects:

* Class date (from a capacity-aware dropdown of upcoming dates)
* Number of seats (default 1, up to seats remaining for the chosen date)
* Name and email (and optional waiver, Mailchimp opt-in, and custom fields)

Submitting calls the WordPress REST API: `POST /wp-json/stripe-bookings/v1/checkout`.

**2. Soft-hold and session creation**

The server validates the class, date, capacity, and form rules, then:

* Creates a **pending** booking post with a **30-minute soft-hold** so seats are reserved while the customer pays.
* Calls `Stripe\Checkout\Session::create()` with:
  * `mode: payment`
  * **Inline line items** via `price_data` (no pre-created Stripe Products required) — product name is built from your settings template and class metadata; currency is GBP.
  * `quantity` = number of seats; `unit_amount` = class price in pence.
  * `customer_email` when provided on the form.
  * `success_url` and `cancel_url` pointing at your result pages (with `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` on success for status polling).
  * `expires_at` aligned with the soft-hold window.
  * **Metadata** on the session and payment intent: `booking_id`, `class_id`, `class_date`, `seats`.

The API returns the Checkout Session URL; JavaScript redirects the customer to **checkout.stripe.com**.

**3. Customer pays on Stripe**

On Stripe’s page the customer completes payment (card, wallets, and other methods enabled in your Stripe Dashboard). Stripe may also collect or confirm billing details depending on your Checkout settings.

**4. Webhook confirms the booking**

Configure a webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks:

`https://yoursite.com/wp-json/stripe-bookings/v1/stripe-webhook`

Listen for:

* `checkout.session.completed` — marks the booking **paid**, stores customer details from the session, optionally subscribes to Mailchimp, and sends emails.
* `checkout.session.expired` — releases the soft-hold.
* `checkout.session.async_payment_failed` — treats the booking as expired.

The plugin verifies the **webhook signing secret** from settings before processing events. Processing is **idempotent** (duplicate `completed` events are ignored if already paid).

**5. Return URLs and status polling**

After payment, Stripe redirects to your **Booking Confirmed** page. The `[stripe_booking_status]` shortcode polls `GET /wp-json/stripe-bookings/v1/booking-status?session=cs_...` and shows confirmation details. If the webhook is delayed, the plugin can **reconcile** by fetching the session from Stripe directly.

If the customer abandons Checkout or the session expires, they land on **Booking Cancelled** or the hold is cleared via webhook/cron.

**6. Capacity and expiry**

Seats taken for a (class, date) = **paid** bookings + **pending** bookings whose `expires_at` is still in the future. A scheduled cron expires stale holds every five minutes; the webhook remains the authoritative path for paid and expired Checkout sessions.

### Front-end embedding

* **Shortcode:** `[stripe_booking class_id="123"]` — also accepts `class_slug`, `stripe_booking_id`, or legacy `yoga_booking` alias.
* **Status shortcode:** `[stripe_booking_status type="success"]` (or `cancelled`, `error`).
* **Elementor:** **Class Booking with Stripe** widget — pick a class by ID or read `stripe_booking_id` from the current post in loops/templates.

### Requirements and bundled dependencies

* WordPress 6.x recommended.
* **ACF** — If Advanced Custom Fields (Free or Pro) is already active, the plugin uses it. Otherwise the plugin loads a **bundled copy of ACF Free** from `vendor/acf/`.
* **Stripe account** — Publishable key, secret key, and webhook signing secret (separate test and live keys in settings).
* **Elementor** (optional) — Only needed for the Elementor widget; the shortcode works without it.
* **PHP 7.2+** (required by bundled stripe-php; PHP 7.4+ recommended).
* **stripe-php** SDK is bundled under `vendor/stripe/stripe-php/` — no Composer step on the server.

### Privacy and data

Bookings store customer name, email, class, date, seats, payment status, and optional waiver/Mailchimp/extra field data in WordPress post meta. Payment card data is handled entirely by Stripe, not stored in WordPress.

### Support

Documentation and setup notes are included in the plugin admin under **Classes → Settings**. For issues and feature requests, use the support forum on WordPress.org once published, or the contact URL on the plugin listing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

= Does this plugin store credit card numbers? =

No. Card entry and processing happen on **Stripe Checkout**. WordPress only stores booking metadata and Stripe session/payment intent IDs.

= Do I need WooCommerce? =

No. This plugin is a lightweight alternative for **single-class, date-based** bookings with Stripe Checkout.

= Do I need ACF Pro? =

No. The plugin works with **ACF Free or Pro** if already installed. If neither is active, it loads **bundled ACF Free** automatically.

= Do I need to create Products in Stripe? =

No. Each Checkout Session uses **inline `price_data`** built from the class price and your line-item title template in settings.

= Which Stripe events must the webhook listen for? =

`checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, and `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`.

= What happens if two people book the last seat at the same time? =

The first successful checkout creation gets a soft-hold. The second request receives a capacity error if no seats remain. Paid bookings and non-expired holds count toward capacity.

= How long is a seat held before payment? =

**30 minutes**, matching the Checkout Session `expires_at`. Expired holds are cleared by webhook and a five-minute cron job.

= Can I cancel a single date without disabling the whole class? =

Yes. On the Class edit screen, add the date to the **Cancelled dates** repeater.

= Can I send customers elsewhere instead of Stripe? =

Yes. Enable **Booking mode: use external link** on a class and set the external URL (e.g. Eventbrite).

= Does it work with Elementor? =

Yes. Register the **Class Booking with Stripe** widget when Elementor is active. You can also use the shortcode in any editor.

= Which currency is supported? =

Checkout sessions are created in **GBP** (pence). Changing currency would require a code customisation today.

= How are emails sent? =

Via WordPress **`wp_mail()`** using templates you edit under **Settings → Emails**, with merge tags such as `{customer_name}`, `{class_date}`, `{seats}`, `{amount_total}`, and others listed in the admin.

= Can I add a waiver or newsletter opt-in? =

Yes. **Form extras** in settings support a waiver checkbox (with optional policy page link), Mailchimp opt-in (API key and audience ID), and additional ACF fields shown on the form.

= What if my webhook does not fire on local development? =

Use the Stripe CLI to forward events, or a tunnel (ngrok, etc.) so Stripe can reach your REST webhook URL. The success page also polls Stripe as a fallback when webhooks are delayed.

= Are there legacy shortcode names? =

Yes. `[yoga_booking]` and `[yoga_booking_status]` remain as aliases for older sites.
